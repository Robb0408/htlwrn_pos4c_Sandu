## Remarks
- I would have liked a bit more live demo.
- A short sample in JSFiddle or .NET Fiddle (dotnetfiddle.net) would have been cool.
- Maybe also a list of tools like Miro, Figma, Trello, IFTTT, Zapier, etc.
- Something funny like: [devRant - A fun community for developers to connect over code, tech & life as a programmer](https://devrant.com/).
